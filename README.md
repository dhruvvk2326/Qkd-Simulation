# Qkd-Simulation
PROJECT DEMONSTRATION
This is the implementation, working, and outcome of the Quantum Cryptography key distribution system using the BB84 protocol with the support of IBM Qiskit Composer. 
The principles of quantum key distribution, especially its contribution toward secure communication. The role of quantum mechanics in generation of private keys that are distributed to all the users involved in the communication, such as through superposition and measurement collapse.
o	Main Objective: Provide key establishment between Alice, sender, and Bob, receiver, with the principles of quantum. Also provide simulation of all the intermeditiary steps using proper tools

o	Tools and Environment
-	Software Used : AerSimulator and IBM Qiskit Composer.
-	Language: Python, primarily for simulation and OpenQASM, which represents low-level circuit design.
-	Framework: Quantum Circuit Design using Qubits and Gates Encoding, Transmission, and Measurement of Quantum States.
